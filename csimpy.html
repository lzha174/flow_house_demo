    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      CSimPy is a lightweight C++20 coroutine-based discrete event simulation engine, inspired by SimPy. It is designed to model asynchronous workflows and resource contention efficiently, offering better control and performance than Python-based systems in performance-critical environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework enables you to define coroutine-based processes that wait for events, interact with resources, and yield control based on simulation time.

  <section class="features">
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Native C++20 coroutine support</li>
      <li>Efficient event queue for large-scale simulation</li>
      <li>Support for resource acquisition and release semantics</li>
      <li>Customizable simulation clock and event scheduling</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="applications">
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
      CSimPy is suitable for simulating manufacturing workflows, embedded systems, queueing networks, and moreâ€”where performance, concurrency, and low-level control are essential.
